A mobile shopping cart application that allows you to buy items based on budget and priority while saving the previously bought items to a SQLite database

Create a budget
Enter items based on criteria (Product Name, Quantity, Priority, Price)
When all items are added, choose the credit card or "Go Shopping" option
This will list all items by priority and highlight bought items in Green, while items that were not purchased in Red
The next time that you start the application, the items that you bought the previous time will show up as a toast
